# Snake-Game

### This is a simple Java program of the classic snake and apple game. The snake (blue) grows in length and moves faster each time it eats an apple (red) by running into it. Control the direction of the snake's path using the `up`,`down`,`left` and `right` keys. The goal is to eat as many apples as possible while avoiding collision with the borders and the snake itself.

To run the program in the command terminal, navigate to the `Snake-Game` folder:
```
$ cd .../Snake-Game
```
Compile the source files:
```
$ javac hw4/*.java
```

Run the following file containing the `main` function to initiate the game:
```
$ java hw4.SnakeGame
```

Here is what the game interface looks like:
