# Snake-Game

### This is a simple Java program of the classic snake and apple game. The snake (green) grows in length each time it eats an apple (red) by running into it. The goal is to eat as many apples as possible while avoiding collision with the borders and the snake itself.

To run the program in the command terminal, navigate to the `Snake-Game` folder:
```
$ cd .../Snake-Game
```
Compile the source files:
```
$ javac hw4/*.java
```

Run the following file containing the `main` function to initiate the game:
```
$ java hw4.SnakeGame
```
